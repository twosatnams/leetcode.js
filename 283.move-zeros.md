## Question
Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

For example, given nums = [0, 1, 0, 3, 12], after calling your function, nums should be [1, 3, 12, 0, 0].

Note:
1. You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
2. Minimize the total number of operations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question asks us to do this in place. What if that was not the case?

We could simply count zeros and push non-zero elements in a new array. And then push num of zeros at the end.

But how to do this in place?

We could use two pointers and replace in elements in them in a smart way.

How about this?
1. Start two pointers `first` and `second`.
2. Keep moving until `first` is a zero.
3. When `first` is a zero.
  3.1. Keep moving `second` forward until you see a non-zero element.
  3.2. Replace `first` and `second` elements.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

```
def move_zeros(nums)
  first = 0
  second = 0

  while second < nums.length
    if nums[first] == 0
      while nums[second] == 0
        second += 1
      end
      nums[first] = nums[second] || 0
      nums[second] = 0
    end
    first += 1
    second += 1
  end

  return nums
end

p move_zeros([0, 1, 0, 3, 12])
p move_zeros([0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 4])
p move_zeros([1,2,3,0,0,5,0,0])
```
